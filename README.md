# Metastudio
My library of abstractions for Pure Data.

I started the Metastudio project in 2004, as a library of abstractions for Pure Data that use external libraries of objects.

To use the whole of the library, you will need to install the following externals from the "Find externals" tool in the help menu of Pure Data:

iemlib
zexy
ekext
creb
cyclone
ggee
motex
sigpack
hcs
maxlib
ext13
tof
moonlib

Enjoy!
